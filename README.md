# One-Shot

Repository for the upcoming [paper](upcoming url!) "One-Shot Exit Wavefunction Reconstruction". 

One-shot exit wavefunction with deep learning uses deep learning to recover phases of conventional transmission electron microscopy images by restricting the distribution of wavefunctions.

Phases output by a neural network for input amplitudes are similar to true phases for In1.7K2Se8Sn2.28 wavefunctions.
